> ⚠️ Domain propagation (the process whereby nameservers update across the internet to reflect a change in a domain's DNS record) takes 0 - 48 hours to start working in all locations across the internet. Once your domain propagates, we will automatically provision an SSL certificate for you when you visit your blog for the first time.
