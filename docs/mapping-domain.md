When you create your Hashnode blog, we provide a free **yourdomain.hashnode.dev** subdomain for you. However, you can set up your own **yourdomain.tld** domain or **blog.yourdomain.tld** subdomain to your Hashnode blog.

In this guide, you will learn how to accomplish this alongside some additional specific guides for different domain DNS providers.

1. Log in to your Hashnode account.

2. Click on your **profile picture** at the bottom-left corner of the page on *desktop* screen or top-right corner on *mobile* screen.

4. Navigate to the **DOMAIN** tab and enter your domain without the **www** or **https://** prefix in the text field provided. Then click on the **Update** button to proceed.

5. If your DNS provider supports CNAME record, head over to your DNS provider and add a **CNAME record** where the hostname is **@**, and the corresponding value is **hashnode.network**. This CNAME record will point your domain or subdomain to Hashnode's IP address.

> It's not recommended to use the CNAME record at the root level (e.g., **yourdomain.tld**) unless your DNS provider supports [CNAME flattening](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cname-flattening-rfc-compliant-cnames-at-a-domains-root) as this will affect your domain's MX records and email service.

6. If your DNS provider does not support CNAME flattening, add an **A record** at the root whose value is **192.241.200.144**. However, you will lose the benefits of our global CDN and edge caching with this approach.

Still not sure if your DNS provider supports CNAME flattering or when to use CNAME or A record? Here is a quick summary to guide you:

- If you are setting up a domain at the root level (e.g., yourdomain.tld**), and your DNS provider supports CNAME flattening, **use a CNAME record**.
- If you are setting up a root domain and your DNS provider does not support CNAME flattening, **use an A record**.
- If you set up a sub-domain (e.g., **blog.yourdomain.tld**), **use a CNAME record** without any worries.
