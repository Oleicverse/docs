title: Style Guidelines
---

Every internal project and major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions (sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to “never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” This project ([oleicverse/styleguide](#)) links to the style guidelines we use for Oleic code. If you are modifying a project that originated at Oleic, you may be pointed to this page to see the style guides that apply to that project.

This project holds the [Python Style Guide](#), [HTML/CSS Style Guide](#), [JavaScript Style Guide](#), [TypeScript Style Guide](#), [AngularJS Style Guide](#).
