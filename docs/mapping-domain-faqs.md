title: Mapping to Custom Domain FAQs

Find below frequently asked questions about mapping a custom domain to Hashnode:

## How long does it take for the DNS to propagate?

Domain propagation (the process whereby nameservers update across the internet to reflect a change in a domain's DNS record) takes 0 - 48 hours to start working in all locations across the internet.

## How will I know when my domain has been mapped successfully?

You can use any DNS Propagation Checker of [this](https://www.whatsmydns.net/) to check the current state of your DNS propagation.

## Does Hashnode handle the SSL certification?

Once your domain propagates, we'll automatically provision an SSL certificate for you when you visit your blog for the first time. If you are using something like Cloudflare, please bypass it for this domain.
